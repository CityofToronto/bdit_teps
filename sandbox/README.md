# Volume Model Sandbox

This is a sandbox for experimenting with new technologies to use for the Volume
Model.  It is hosted under the `sandbox` branch, which is intended to be even
with `master` except for the contents of this folder.

Each experiment is in a folder, whose name follows the format

```
<DATE>_<EXPERIMENT_TYPE>
