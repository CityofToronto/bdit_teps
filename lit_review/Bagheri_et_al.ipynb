    "[Bagheri et al. 2013 - Improving AADT Estimation Accuracy of Short-Term Traffic Counts Using Pattern Matching and Bayesian Statistics](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29TE.1943-5436.0000528):\n",

    "### Introduction\n",
    "* FHWA Traffic Monitoring Guide (TMG) defines:\n",
    "  * Continuous count - on a road segment permanently 24/7/365, generated by permanent traffic counters (PTCs)\n",
    "  * Short-term traffic counts - 1-7 day blocks every few years; need adjustment or expansion factors to uprade them to AADTs.\n",
    "* TMG recommends \"factoring\":\n",
    "  1. Grouping PTCs by road class.\n",
    "  2. Calculating conversions from daily volume to AADT for each class.\n",
    "  3. Assigning short-term counts to corresponding PTC groups.\n",
    "  4. Estimate STTC AADTs.\n",
    "* Problem - potentially very different seasonal variation between different roads of same class.\n",
    "* Alternative: regression analysis - do OLS on STTC vs. PTC data, see which has largest $R^2$ (Robichaud & Gordon 2003)\n",
    "* Problems:\n",
    "  * Requires >6 STTC counts throughout the year (for all seasons).\n",
    "  * Computationally expensive.\n",
    "* ANN (Sharma et al. 2000) - comparable to factoring.  Problem: difficult to understand and implement.\n",
    "* Bayesian factoring (Davis & Guan 1996) - 5% MAPE, 20% worst case percentage error.  Problem: algorithmically complex, requires 14-day data collection periods.\n",
    "* Lit review suggests primarily FHWA TMG used, or regression analysis when more data available.\n",
    "* Moreover\n",
    "\n",
    "### MSE Method\n",
    "* Strong spatial clustering among traffic annual growth rates of roads, indicating nearby roads have similar annual growth rates.\n",
    "* Growth rate of closest PTC with same functional class usually has the highest correlation with that of STTC.\n",
    "* To obtain the seasonal pattern of STTC, we must convert the short-term count collected on a specific day of week in a month to its MADT value.  We do this by determining the ratio between the MADT and average daily traffic for a specific day of week in that month.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{DoM}_{dij}=\\mathrm{MADT}_{ij}\\frac{n_{d,j}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{n_{d,j}}\\mathrm{DT}_{d,k}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\mathrm{MADT}_{ij}$ is monthly averaged daily traffic in year $i$, month $j$, $\\mathrm{DoM}_{dij}$ \"day of month factor\" for day of week (eg. Monday = 0) $d$, year $i$ and month $j$, $\\mathrm{DT}_{d,k}$ is daily traffic for day $d$ of week $k$ of month $j$, $n_{d,j}$ is the number of days of week $d$ in $j$.  For example, for Monday of January 2010, $\\mathrm{DoM}$ is the ratio between the MADT of January 2010 with the average daily traffic for all Mondays in January 2010.\n",
    "* Then, historical STTCs can be converted to MADTs for year of interest $p$ and month $j$ using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{MADT}_{pj} = \\mathrm{STTC}_{dij} \\times \\mathrm{DoM}_{dij} \\times \\prod_{k=i}^p GR_k\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\mathrm{STTC}_{dij}$ is the collected short-term traffic count on day of week $d$ of month $j$ and year $i$ (which I assume means it's the average of all days that are Monday, Tuesday, etc.).  $GR_k$ is the annual traffic growth rate for year $k$ obtained from the nearest PTC located on the same functional class\n",
    "* Bagheri recommends in cases where multiple counts are available for the same month but different years, the best estimate MADT should be an average of those calculated from the above equation.\n",
    "* Next, we divide $\\mathrm{MADT}_{pj}$ by $\\mathrm{AADT}_{p}$ to get a normalized seasonal pattern.  Since $\\mathrm{AADT}_{p}$ isn't available, we instead estimate the AADT with $\\mathrm{AADTprelim}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{AADTprelim}_p = \\frac{\\sum \\mathrm{STTC}_{dij} \\times D_{dij} \\times \\prod_{k=i}^p GR_k}{n}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Here, we take the average of all scaled $\\mathrm{STTC}_{dij}$ available to us.  The scaling factor $D_{dij}$ comes from the nearest PTC located on the same functional class, and is the annual equivalent to $\\mathrm{DoM}_{dij}$:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Here, $s$ is the short term count site, $m$ is the permanent count site, and $N$ the number of data points shared between $s$ and $m$.\n",
    "* Once the minimum MSE is found, we assign the PTC to the STTC, and find the AADT of the STTC using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "AADT = \\mathrm{STTC}_{dij} \\times D_{dij}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Here, we take the most recent STTC observation, and the corresponding day-to-year conversion from the assigned PTC.\n",
    "\n",
    "### COV Method\n",
    "\n",
    "* To minimize the added errors introduced by using $\\mathrm{AADTprelim}_p$, an alternative method uses the ratio between PTC and STTC MADTs (MADT is still calculated using the $\\mathrm{MADT}_{pj}$ equation above).  We calculate the coeffficient of variation for each month where STTC data is available:\n",

    "## Differences between Bagheri MSE and TEPs-I\n",
    "\n",
    "* TEPs-I doesn't distinguish between different road classes (notably, it doesn't distinguish between expressways and major arterials).\n",
    "* Bagheri uses a growth rate from the nearest PTC, and calculates these rates for year $k$.  In `PTCYEAR.m`, Arman uses the average over all years of the year on year exponential growth rate ($N$ is the number of AADTs we have):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r = \\frac{1}{N - 1} \\sum_i^{N - 1} \\frac{\\ln(\\mathrm{AADT}_{i+1}/\\mathrm{AADT}_i)}{y_{i+1} - y_i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Then he calculates a growth rate with $GR = 1 + r$ (which is formally incorrect, but the Taylor expansion works out).\n",
    "* To calculate $\\prod_{k=i}^p GR_k$, he uses $GR^{(p - i)}$.  This smooths out any year-on-year changes in the growth rate.\n",
    "* Furthermore, in `DoMSTTC.m`, he averages over all PTCs, effectively using the Toronto global PTC growth rate rather than the nearest PTC.\n",
    "* In `SEL_ratio.m`, he performs an MADT average weighted by the the number of available days in each month that are the same day of week as the STTC day of week.\n",
    "* Also in `SEL_ratio.m`, he deviates from Eqn. 4 in Bagheri by calculating $D$ as the ratio between AADT and daily count for each day of the year, then averages all $D$ for the same day of week to multiply for $\\mathrm{AADTprelim}_p$.\n",
    "* Because we don't have nearby PTC data for every year we have STTC data, TEPs finds the closest year with same day-of-week (or just closest year if same day-of-week data doesn't exist) data from each of the nearest 5 PTC stations.  The $i$ in Eqn. 2, 3 and 4 in Bagheri is treated as the closest year we have relevant PTC data.  For example, if we're looking at 2006 data that we want to estimate forward to 2018, but the closest PTC year we have is 2016, $\\prod_{k=i}^p GR_k = GR^2$, not $GR^{12}$.\n",
    "* TEPS doesn't consider nearby PTCs only from the same road class (probably because then we'd have too little data).\n",
    "* TEPs uses the last year of data rather than the latest STTC (in some cases that just means taking 3 days of data rather than 1, but I believe it helps reduce noise)."

    "* Due to our lack of PTCs, we also don't distinguish between different road classes - we assign simply based on the closest PTC.\n",
    "* Average year-on-year growth rates are calculated by fitting a line to weekly-averaged daily traffic (for one year of data) or an exponential to AADT (for multi-year data).  The slopes or growth rates are converted to average fractional year-on-year growth, then multiplied as $GR^{(p - i)}$.\n",
    "* Because we don't have nearby PTC data for every year we have STTC data, CountMatch also finds the closest year with available to data.  The $i$ in Eqn. 2, 3 and 4 in Bagheri is treated as the closest year.\n",
    "* Bagheri Eqn. 6 is the sum of square errors, not the mean (not that it matters, since all PTCs have all 12 months represented, it's the STTCs that could have missing months).  We use the mean.\n",
