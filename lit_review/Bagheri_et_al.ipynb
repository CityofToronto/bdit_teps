    "[Bagheri et al. 2013 - Improving AADT Estimation Accuracy of Short-Term Traffic Counts Using Pattern Matching and Bayesian Statistics](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29TE.1943-5436.0000528):\n",

    "MSE Method:\n",
    "* Strong spatial clustering among traffic annual growth rates of roads, indicating nearby roads have similar annual growth rates.\n",
    "* Growth rate of closest PTC with same functional class usually has the highest correlation with that of STTC.\n",
    "* To obtain the seasonal pattern of STTC, we must convert the short-term count collected on a specific day of week in a month to its MADT value.  We do this by determining the ratio between the MADT and average daily traffic for a specific day of week in that month.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{DoM}_{dij}=\\mathrm{MADT}_{ij}\\frac{n_{d,j}}{\\sum_{k=1}^{n_{d,j}}\\mathrm{DT}_{d,k}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\mathrm{MADT}_{ij}$ is monthly averaged daily traffic in year $i$, month $j$, $\\mathrm{DoM}_{dij}$ \"day of month factor\" for day of week (eg. Monday = 0) $d$, year $i$ and month $j$, $\\mathrm{DT}_{d,k}$ is daily traffic for day $d$ of week $k$ of month $j$, $n_{d,j}$ is the number of days of week $d$ in $j$.  For example, for Monday of January 2010, $\\mathrm{DoM}$ is the ratio between the MADT of January 2010 with the average daily traffic for all Mondays in January 2010.\n",
    "* Then, historical STTCs can be converted to MADTs for year of interest $p$ and month $j$ using:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathrm{MADT}_{pj} = \\mathrm{STTC}_{dij} \\times \\mathrm{DoM}_{dij} \\times \\prod_{k=i}^p GR_k\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\mathrm{STTC}_{dij}$ is the collected short-term traffic count on day of week $d$ of month $j$ and year $i$ (which I assume means it's the average of all days that are Monday, Tuesday, etc.).  $GR_k$ is the annual traffic growth rate for year $k$ obtained from the nearest PTC located on the same functional class - for a fixed $GR_k$ (assumed by Arman), $\\prod_{k=i}^p GR_k = GR_k^{(p - i)}$\n",
    "* Bagheri recommends in cases where multiple counts are available for the same month but different years, the best estimate MADT should be an average of those calculated from the above equation.\n",
    "* Next, we divide $\\mathrm{MADT}_{pj}$ by $\\mathrm{AADT}_{p}$ to get a normalized seasonal pattern.  Since $\\mathrm{AADT}_{p}$ isn't available, we instead estimate the AADT with $\\mathrm{AADTprelim}$:\n",

    "* Here, we take the average of all scaled $\\mathrm{STTC}_{dij}$ available to us.  The scaling factor $\\times D_{dij}$ comes from the nearest PTC located on the same functional class, and is the annual equivalent to $\\mathrm{DoM}_{dij}$:\n",

    "\n",
    "* Assignment of STTC sites using the MSE method is done by computing the value of MSE for all available PTCs:\n",
