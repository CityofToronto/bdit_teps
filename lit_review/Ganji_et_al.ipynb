    "Methodology for spatio-temporal predictions of traffic counts across an urban road network and generation of an on-road greenhouse gas emission inventory\n",
    "\n",
    "- GHG emission inventories required to determine environmental impact of transportation, plan for mitigation.  Existing methods have biases of 100% or more due to mismatch between proxies for vehicle volumes and actual volumes on streets.  Ideally would like a GHG inventory from bottom-up source data.  Problem is that cities typically use travel demand models for such studies, which (because of reliance on household travel survey information) underestimate total emissions.\n",
    "- Map of citywide vehicle volume ideal, but expensive to track all vehicles on all streets with remote sensing.\n",
    "- Possible solution: interpolate volume based on traffic count data.  This is hard because most traffic volume prediction methods (eg. regression - [Taylor et al. 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364815203002627); SVM - [Yao et al. 2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/mice.12221)) require long data records for parameter estimation.\n",
    "- TEPs is a multi-stage spatio-temporal regression and interpolation model that is able to augment traffic count stations with short or sparse records using data from those with long records.\n",
